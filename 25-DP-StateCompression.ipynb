    "# State Compression DP\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "State compression DP uses an bitmask to represent a set of states compactly:\n",
    "- Each bit in the integer corresponds to whether an item or a condition is \"active\" or \"used.\"\n",
    "- This compact representation reduces memory usage and allows for efficient manipulation of states using bitwise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical Use Cases\n",
    "Subset Problems:\n",
    "  - Problems that involve checking or generating subsets of a given set, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n",
    "Assignment Problems:\n",
    "  - Tasks that involve assigning a set of workers to a set of jobs with constraints.\n",
    "Graph Problems:\n",
    "  - Problems that involve paths or cycles in graphs, such as finding the shortest Hamiltonian path.\n",
    "Games and Puzzles:\n",
    "  - Problems where the current state of a game board can be encoded as a bitmask (e.g., solving N-puzzle-like problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "Exponential Growth:\n",
    "- The number of states grows exponentially with the size of the input: **O(2^n)** for n elements\n",
    "Memory Usage:\n",
    "- Even though the representation is compact, the DP table or memoization array can still be large: **O(2^n)**.\n",
    "Thus, for a interview problem, if you want to use State Compression DP, the input size should be smaller or equals to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Bitwise Operations in State Compression DP\n",
    "- Set a bit: `status |= (1 << i)`        \n",
    "- Clear a bit: `status &= ~(1 << i) `        \n",
    "- Check if a bit is set: `(status & (1 << i)) != 0`    \n",
    "- Count the number of bits set: `bin(status).count('1')`       "

    "A salesman needs to visit all cities exactly once and return to the starting point. Find the shortest path. Note that every city is connected to all other cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**      \n",
    "We use a bitmask `status` to represent visited cities(e.g., 10101 means cities 1, 3, and 5 are visited).\n",
    "Then we define `dp[status][i]`: the cost to visited all cities starting from city `i` and go back to the city `0`, while the salesman have traveled to cities in `status`."
