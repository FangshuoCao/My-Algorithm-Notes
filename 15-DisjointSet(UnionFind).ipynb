    "The **Union-Find**, also known as **Disjoint-Set**, is a data structure used to manage which set elements belong to. The data structure is usually implemented as a forest, where each tree represents a set, and the nodes in the tree represent the elements in the corresponding set.      \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Union-Find?\n",
    "If we only want to know whether an element is in a set, we can use language's built-in hash set. However, if we need to find out whether two elements belong to the same set, then hash set is not enough, so we need to use Union-Find.     \n",
    "\n",
    "### Union-Find Operations:\n",
    "1. **Union(x, y)**: Merges the sets to which two elements belong (combine the two trees).\n",
    "2. **Find(x)**: Find the representative of the set x belongs to(root node of the tree).\n",
    "3. **IsSameSet(x, y)**: return true is two elements are in the same set, false otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization:\n",
    "**Path Compression**: When performing find() by moving up on the tree, we link each node encountered along the way to the root. Path compression reduces the tree's height, thus speeding up future find() operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Union by Rank**: During the union() operation, we attaches the tree with a lower \"rank\" (size or depth) to the root of the tree with a higher rank. This strategy helps minimize the overall tree height, as the smaller tree always becomes a subtree of the larger tree, preventing the structure from becoming unbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "**O(1)** for each operation on average\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "Union-Find is typically used to solve problems related to **relationships between different elements**, such as determining whether two people are related or if there is at least one path connecting two nodes in a graph. It can also be used to find the number of distinct sets, the number of elements in a set, etc."
