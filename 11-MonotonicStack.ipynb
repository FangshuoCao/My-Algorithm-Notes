    "# 1. Use Mono Stack to Find Next/Previous Smaller/Larger Element\n",
    "Monotonic Stack maintaining elements in either increasing or decreasing order.          \n",
    "It is commonly used to solve the problem of **finding the next and previous greater/smaller element for each element in an array**.            \n",
    "Without monotonic stack, in a ordinary approach we have to iterate to the left and to the right for each index, thus having a time complexity of O(n^2).   \n",
    "Using a monotonic stack allow us to do this in **O(n)**."

    "### Procedure\n",
    "1. Create a monotonic stack, the stack follows this rule: **elements on top must be strictly larger than all elements below it**\n",
    "2. iterate through the original array.\n",
    "3. If `stack.empty` or `nums[stack.peek] < nums[i]`, push `i` onto the stack. Note that our stack stores index rather than value\n",
    "4. When the top of the stack is larger, **pop all elements that is larger or equals to nums[i]**, then push i onto the stack\n",
    "5. After we finish iterate through the entire array, pop all the elements that are left on the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "### We Collect Answer Whenever An Element is Popped\n",
    "Whenever a element `X` is popped from the stack:\n",
    "1. Its nearest smaller number on left is the new top of the stack. If the stack is empty after popping `X`, then there is no smaller element on `X`'s left \n",
    "2. If it is popped because of we are trying to push a smaller element `Y` on to the stack, `X`'s nearest smaller number on right is `Y`\n",
    "3. If it is popped during the cleaning stage, there is no smaller element on `X`'s right\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Equivalence (Duplicate Values)\n",
    "Suppose we are trying to push 5->3 (index->value) on to the stack. What if top of the stack is also 3?(for example 3->3)        \n",
    "We still pop it and collect answer for 3->3 anyway and fix it later.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after we empty the stack, there might be some places in our answer array that is incorrect due to duplicate value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can fix those answer in one run.         \n",
    "For each element in the answer array, we check if the `nums[smaller[i][1]] == nums[i]`.    \n",
    "If this is true, it means that we find a value that is incorrectly popped. To fix this, we just let `smaller[i][1] = smaller[smaller[i][1]][1]`.       \n",
    "We only check right because in our stack, the top element is strictly larger than bottom element. Therefore our left answer is always correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **You should design the strategy to handle equivalence value based on the SPECIFIC PROBLEM**\n",
    "Each problem should has its own way for handling equivalence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "**O(n)**: Because each element was pushed and popped from the stack only once.         \n",
    "Thus the average for a single element is O(1) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Monotonocity:\n",
    "If you are looking for **nearest smaller**, stack should be: **large on top, small on bottom.**                \n",

    "If you are looking for **nearest larger**, stack should be: **small on top, large on bottom.**"
