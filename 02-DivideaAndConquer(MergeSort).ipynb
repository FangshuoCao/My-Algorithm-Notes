    "**Principles: When to use Divide and Conquer?**\n",
    "We need to ask ourselves 2 questions:\n",
    "1. Can the problem be divided into smaller parts?                \n",
    "   **Condition 1:** answer(full range) = answer(left part) + answer(right part) + answer(crossing left and right)           \n",
    "2. When calculating the \"crossing answer,\" does sorting make it easier to find our answer?                  \n",
    "   **Condition 2:** It is easier for us to find answer when left part and right part are sorted\n",
    "        \n",
    "If both condition are met, the question should very likely be solved using Divide and Conquer           \n",
    "Merge sort is often added because sorting the left and right parts simplifies the calculation of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes:\n",
    "1. Some problems solved using divide-and-conquer can also be tackled with segment trees or tree-like array techniques.\n",
    "2. The problems discussed here are common examples of divide-and-conquer techniques, with varying levels of difficulty. Divide-and-conquer can not only solve simple problems but can also address more challenging issues, as long as the problem fits this pattern. Top companies rarely ask such problems because they are less common but still essential for theory."

    "**Solution:**       \n",
    "Why should we use divide-and-conquer?         \n",
    "1. We can divide the problem into smaller problems, and then add their result together. This question fulfill the requirement for our condition 1 above        \n",
    "2. Using divide-and-conquer, we know that recursion will take care of the smallSum in left and right, so we just need to find the smallSum across left and right\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The fact that both left and right part allow us to find the smallSum across: we just need to find the smallSum of each elements on rightPart regarding each elements on the left. Because the array is sorted, the elements on the left that contributes to 2 will also contribute to 4, which means that both our pointer i and j will only need to move right and will not step back, achieving a time of O(n) in our merge although there's a nested loop\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. If left and right are not sorted, we will have to iterate on every elements in the left for each element in the right, having time complexity O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. This is a perfect example for the condition2 above---the fact that both array are sorted make it much easier for us"
