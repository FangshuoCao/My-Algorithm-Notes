    "# 1. Monotonic Queue Classical Technique\n",
    "### Monotonic Queue can be used to dynamically keep track of the Min/Max value in a Sliding Window\n",
    "Note that our monotonic queue is a **Deque**        \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to keep track of Max value, then the queue are Max->Min, meaning elements in front are strictly larger    \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to keep track of Min value, the queue is Min->Max, meaning elements in front are strictly smaller\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the head in the queue is the min/max value we want to keep track of given the current window\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure:\n",
    "Suppose we want to keep track of max value\n",
    "When an element `num` enters the sliding window(when the window grows), we check its value\n",
    "- If `num < tail`, directly push num to tail\n",
    "- If `num >= tail`, pop all element smaller than `num` from tail, then push `num` to tail\n",
    "\n",
    "When an element `num` is kicked out from the window(when the window shrink), we check\n",
    "- If `head` is still in the window after it shrinks, meaning that the index of head is in the range [l, r], do nothing. `head` is still the max value\n",
    "- If `head` is nolonger in the window after it shrinks, pop `head`\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our monotonic stack is continue updating itself with the growth or shrinks of the sliding window\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle Behind:\n",
    "Again, similar to monotonic stack, monotonic queue contains all the **candidates** of answer we are trying to find\n",
    "- Therefore when an element is pushed into the queue, it 'kick our' all worse candidate than it\n",
    "- And when an element is popped, it means that it is no longer a candidate(it is no longer useful for our answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "Because each element can only enters or exit the queue for 1 time, the total time complexity for the entire array is O(n)\n",
    "Thus, the average time complexity if O(1)"
