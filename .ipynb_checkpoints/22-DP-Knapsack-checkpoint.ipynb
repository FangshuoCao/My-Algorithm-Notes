    "Mixed knapsack is combination of different knapsack problems, and this particular problem is a combination of complete knapsack and multi-knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a mixed problem, we need to transform it into one type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, because 1 <= capacity <= 1000, it means that even there is an unlimited item `i` with `costs[i] == 1`, we can still at most choose it for 1000 times, so it's not an unlimited time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, even for a unlimited item, we can still use the binary decomposition technique to transform this mixed knapsack to an ordinary multi-knapsack problem."
