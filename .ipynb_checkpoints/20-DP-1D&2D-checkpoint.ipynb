    "- `newly_added`: The number of new subsequences added to the set after appending a new character.\n",

    "#### Key Insight:\n",
    "When you append letter 'i', `newly_added = total - dp[i]`. Why?\n",
    "- **If `dp[i] == 0`**, it means that 'i' has never been appended before. So, `newlyAdded == total`, because we append 'i' to all previous subsequences, and there will be no repetition.\n",
    "- **If `dp[i] != 0`**, it means that 'i' has already been appended before, so there will be repetition. The number of repeated subsequences is exactly `dp[i]`.\n",

    "   `{}`, `{a}`, `{b}`, `{ab}`, `*{a}*`, `{aa}`, `{ba}`, `{aba}`  \n",
    "   Note that `{a}` is a repetition. `dp[a] = 1` because we already appended 'a' once before.  \n",
    "   After removing the repetition, we get `{}`, `{a}`, `{b}`, `{ab}`, `{aa}`, `{ba}`, `{aba}`.\n",
    "\n",
