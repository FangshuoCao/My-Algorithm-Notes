    "N Queens is probably the most famous backtracking problem. Similar to other backtracking problems, we need to use a `path` variable to represent the previous choices we have made.     \n",
    "\n",
    "In our recursion, we pass the current row as a parameter, so we don't need to worry about rows. We just need to use our `path` to check does a position satisfies the row and diagonal requirement.       \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide two ways to build our `path`\n",
    "1. Using an array as `path`\n",
    "    - Create an array of size N, where `i` is the row and `path[i]` is the column where the queen is at on that row. Therefore, checking column is easy.\n",
    "    - To check the diagonal, we simply use the formula `|curRow - prevRow| == |curCol - prevCol|`. If this is true, we have a diagonal conflict.\n",
    "3. Using a integer as path and perform bitwise operations to check"
