    "# Paradigm for Solving Nested Problems\n",
    "### Before You Start:\n",
    "- **Consider how you would approach the problem if there were no nesting.** Simplifying the problem to its base case without nesting can help you understand the structure of the solution.\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Define Global Variable:**\n",
    "   - Define a global variable `int index_to_continue`, which tracks the current position in the problem (e.g., a string or list).\n",
    "2. **Recursive Method `f(i)`:**\n",
    "   - Implement a recursive method `f(i)` that deals with the subproblem starting from index `i`.\n",
    "   - The function should return when it reaches the **end of the list** or encounters the **end of a nested condition**.\n",
    "3. **Return Value:**\n",
    "   - The return value of `f(i)` is the answer to the nested subproblem.\n",
    "4. **Update `index_to_continue` Before Returning:**\n",
    "   - Before returning, `f(i)` should update the global variable `index_to_continue`. This ensures that the upper level of the recursion knows where to continue processing after the current recursive call.\n",
    "5. **Handle Nested Conditions:**\n",
    "   - If `f(i)` encounters the start of another nested part at `j`, it should call `f(j)` to handle the new nested condition. This handles multiple layers of nesting by calling the recursive method again for each new nested level of the problem."
